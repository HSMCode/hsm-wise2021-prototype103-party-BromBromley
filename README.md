# Cheats Do Prosper

This is a one button game created in Unity, currently in its Alpha phase.

## Description

You're invited to a party , where you're playing a good ol' board game with another party guest. Now of course you could play fair and square... but that'd be a bit boring, wouldn't it?

## Getting Started

 - clone the repository
 - run the project in Unity (remember: it's still in its Alpha phase)

### Prerequisites

Unity version 2020.3.19f1
